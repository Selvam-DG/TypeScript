# Optional Chaining (`?.`) & Non-Null Assertion (`!`)



## Optional Chaining (`?.`)

Optional chaining allows you to safely access **nested properties or methods** without manually checking for `null` or `undefined`.

```
ts

const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  address: {
    city: "Wonderland"
  }
};

let city = user?.address?.city; // "Wonderland"
let zip = user?.address?.zip;   // undefined (no error)
```

### Use Cases

- Accessing deeply nested objects
- Optional methods or functions

```ts
user?.getProfile?.();
```

- Prevents runtime errors from accessing undefined or null values.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Non-Null Assertion (`!`)

The `!` operator tells TypeScript: "I know this value is not null or undefined."

```ts
let el = document.getElementById("app")!;
el.innerHTML = "Loaded"; //  TypeScript skips null check
```

###  Use with Caution

You're taking responsibility away from the compilerâ€”use it only when **you're absolutely sure** the value is defined.

```ts
// Example where this could crash
const maybeNull: string | null = null;
const len = maybeNull!.length; //  Runtime error
```

##  Notes

- Optional chaining is a safe and clean way to handle potentially missing values.
- Non-null assertion should be used sparinglyâ€”prefer narrowing with checks like `if (x)` or `x !== null`.

> âœ… These operators help keep your code clean and avoid excessive null checks, but they come with responsibility!
